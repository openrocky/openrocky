## Custom Characters

3. Select voice preferences for each realtime provider
4. Save — the character is immediately selectable

## How Characters Work

### System Prompt Injection

The active character's personality is injected into the system prompt for every interaction:

- **Chat mode** — full personality prompt including tool list and enabled skills
- **Voice mode** — shortened prompt optimized for realtime brevity (omits tool list and skills)

### Voice Mapping

Each character can specify preferred voices for different providers. When switching characters, the voice automatically changes to match.

### Persistence

Characters are stored as JSON files in `Application Support/OpenRockyCharacters/`. A manifest file tracks the active character ID.

## Migration from Souls

The character system replaced an earlier "Souls" system. Rocky automatically migrates old soul definitions to characters on first launch. The migration is transparent to users.

## Character Store

`OpenRockyCharacterStore` (singleton) manages:

- Loading and saving characters
- Active character selection
- Built-in character seeding on first launch
- Soul → Character migration
